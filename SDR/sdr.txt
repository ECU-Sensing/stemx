RTL-SDR is a popular open-source software-defined radio (SDR) project that uses a cheap digital TV tuner based on the RTL2832U chip to receive and decode various radio signals.

To use RTL-SDR in Python, you can use the pyrtlsdr library, which provides a Python wrapper for the RTL-SDR API.

In this example code, we first configure the RTL-SDR parameters using the RtlSdr() object from the pyrtlsdr library. We set the sample rate to 2.4 MHz, the center frequency to 94.9 MHz (which is the frequency of a popular radio station), and the gain to automatic.

We then capture a single spectrum sample using the read_samples() function, which reads a number of samples from the RTL-SDR device and returns them as a numpy array. We then convert the samples to a complex numpy array using the fft() function from the numpy library.

Finally, we plot the magnitude of the spectrum using the plot() function from the matplotlib library and close the RTL-SDR device using the close() function.

Note that you'll need to have an RTL-SDR device connected to your computer and the appropriate drivers installed for this code to work. Also, you'll need to adjust the RTL-SDR parameters (such as the sample rate and center frequency) to suit your needs.
