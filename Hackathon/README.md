# StemX East Carolina University Hack-A-Thon 2023

Welcome to the 2023 StemX East Carolina University Hack-A-Thon! This year's challenge involves integrating image recognition and LoRaWAN technology. The Hack-A-Thon will be conducted in two phases, each scored by points.

## Challenge:

### Phase 1:

In the first phase, each team will work with one StemX kit and the provided Image Capturing Machine Learning (ML) code. Your task is to modify this code to identify and count a chosen pantry item, and transmit the count over LoRa to our network, PITON. 

The transmitted LoRa data must follow the data layout described in the [DATA.md](DATA.md) file provided in your team's folder. 

Once you have completed your modifications and the Raspberry Pi is successfully transmitting data, commit your team's code to the Git repository. **DO NOT PUSH YOUR COMMIT TO THE REMOTE.** This is an important part of Phase 1 and points will be awarded for successful completion.

The majority of points in this phase will be awarded for the fastest time to capability â€” the quicker your team can get your system up and running, the more points you earn. Additional points will be awarded for code efficiency, thorough commenting, and creativity in your code. However, points will be deducted if not all team members contribute to the task. Everyone is expected to participate.

Points for Phase 1 will be scored before the start of Phase 2.

### Phase 2:

At the beginning of Phase 2, there will be additional time allotted to fix your script's accuracy if you rushed to completion in Phase 1.

In the second phase, we will test the accuracy of your system's output. Points will be awarded based on how accurately your system can count the chosen pantry item in comparison to other teams.

The team with the highest total points from both phases will be declared the winner!

## Format:

- There will be a total of 4 teams: two teams with 3 members and two teams with 4 members.
- Teams cannot have more than 3 members from the same school district.
- Each team will be given one StemX kit to work with.

## Getting Started:

1. Each team will be given a folder containing the starter code.
2. Review the provided resources and understand the structure of the starter code.
3. Plan your approach and distribute tasks among team members.
4. Modify the code in your team's folder to complete the challenge.

## When Complete:

When you have finished modifying the code:

1. Commit the changes to your team's folder in the Git repository. If needed, Git credentials can be provided upon request.
2. Make sure your Raspberry Pi is registered with the LoRaWAN network and transmitting data.
3. Check the PITON dashboard to confirm that your data is being received.

## Submission:

Each team is required to submit one set of code. Your submission will be the code in your team's folder in the Git repository and the data transmitted to the PITON network. 

The deadline for completing both phases and submitting your work will be provided by the event organizers.
